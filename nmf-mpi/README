An implementation of the Benson et al. one-pass NMF algorithm that uses the
near-separability assumption to equate NMF on a matrix to column-selection on
the R in its QR factor. Since the matrix is assumed tall-and-skinny, we use
TSQR to get the R fast, then use the XRay algorithm to do the column-selection
on R. This implementation was written by Aditya Devarakonda.
