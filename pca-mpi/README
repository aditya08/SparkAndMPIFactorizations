This code requires HDF5 and arpack-ng to be installed.  See the coriproduction
target in the Makefile for the calling syntax.  Note that it computes the
truncated PCA of *weighted* input data, with particular weights (appropriate
for the climate science application this code was originally written for).
To avoid weighting the data, remove the calls to rescaleRows and computeRowWeights.
