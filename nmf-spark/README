Runs NMF decomposition on the specified data. See build.sbt and
src/computeNMF.sh for calling details. The input is provided in HDF5 format, so
h5spark is required (included in the lib directory with its prerequisites, for
Cori) -- you may need to recompile h5spark for your system. h5spark is
available at https://github.com/valiantljk/h5spark
