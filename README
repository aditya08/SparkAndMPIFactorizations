A collection of code for computing truncated PCAs (Spark and C/MPI),
Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (Spark and C/MPI), and randomized CX (Spark),
used to compile the experimental results in 

"Matrix Factorization at Scale: a Comparison of Scientific Data Analytics in
Spark and C+MPI Using Three Case Studies" by Alex Gittens, Aditya Devarakonda,
Evan Racah, Michael Ringenburg, Lisa Gerhardt, Jey Kottaalam, et al.
(technical report available at https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.01335)

These codes were written to compile on the Cori NERSC System, so some of the
compilation procedures will need to be changed for your system. See the
relevant directories for further details.
